Generally speak, most e30 kswaps utilize the KPower Industries Throttle Body (TB). However, there have been issues that people have run into while using this throttle body.

1. Hard initial engagement which leads to drivability issues from a standstill
2. Butterfly not sealing

People have suggested using the skunk2 TB instead, however it isn't as simple as merely swapping the TB. The skunk2 throttle wheel is designed for a Honda throttle cable, not a BMW which is what people use when using the KPower Industries TB. The design of the Honda throttle cable has no excess cable after the throttle barrel. This barrel slides into the throttle wheel and thus the throttle attaches. Since the BMW throttle cable has excess cable and a ferule on the end, it makes it impossible to install without modifying the throttle wheel of the skunk2 TB.
